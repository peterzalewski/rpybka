Learning HTTP nitty-gritty by writing a toy server

## Overview

What better way to learn HTTP/1.1 and above by implementing a static file HTTP server and reverse proxy? This is a toy project and I do not intend to run it anywhere close to an environment with "production" in the name. Architecture, at least in the beginning, is an afterthought and there will be plenty of dead ends, half-baked ideas, and diversions. Feel free to fork. The stakes are low.
